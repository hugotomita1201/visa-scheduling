  },
  "dependents": [
    {

      "atlas_relation_to_applicant": "Spouse",
      "atlas_first_name": "Yuki",
      "atlas_last_name": "Tomita",
      "atlas_email": "yuki.tomita@gmail.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Option 2: Simple Format**
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",

   - Check for JSON syntax errors
